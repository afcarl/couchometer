Couchometer
===========

An inactivity tracker; sitting kills.

#To-do before it's made public / put on the app store

* Fix 2 minute notification problem
* Fix pause/resume button
* Add bold font to title / custom graphics?
* Make sure it is able to track in the background
* Give an average sit time per day
* Figure out how to generate .apk and put on Google Play store
* Put up couchometer.com (simple jekyll bootstrapped theme)

##Far off future features?
* Syncing to the cloud like rescuetime.com
