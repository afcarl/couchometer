Meta-analyses of the effects of sitting on health are conclusive: sitting kills (c.f. http://www.popsci.com/science/gallery/2013-02/7-ways-sitting-will-kill-you/). 

However, apart from expensive accelerometer-clad wristbands (c.f. Fitbit), no simple app exists to track periods of inactivity and motivate one to stand up and move more often. Parsimony is our goal, and simpler solutions are often best. Hence: 

Couchometer is a simple single-use app designed to increase productivity through timed reminders to take active breaks throughout the day. This is accomplished through light machine learning and battery-conscious polling of accelerometer data.
